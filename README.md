resume.education = [
  {
    school: "University of Pennsylvania",
    location: "Philadelphia, PA",
    degree: "Bachelor of Arts",
    major: "Economics",
    startDate: "2014-09-01",

```

## Roadmap
- Add API reference as a view
- Improvement in style to match a standard resume format and improve readability
- Exception handling for missing fields
- Form integration so users can upload their resume file or form addition with input fields for each field that will then generate the resume page for the user

## Lessons Learned
When building out an API you can really go wild with the routes and include one for every piece of information
